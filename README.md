## Work Experience
**Senior Research Associate-Data Science @ Alliance of BIoversity and International Center for Tropical Agriculture(CIAT) (_July 2023 - Present_)**
- Implemented data science analysis techniques, including machine learning, to explore the correlation between climate, conflict, and human security.
- Supported backend spatial analysis for the Climate Security Observatory(CSO), enhancing stakeholders’ preparedness for climate security risks. My specific contributions can be viewed in the github repository.
- Engaged in collaborative efforts with government ministries and regional blocs to influence the development of
both national and regional policies pertaining to climate change and human security. Significant accomplishments
include in the formulation of the IGAD regional strategy on climate security and the Kenya National Climate
Change Action Plan (NCCAP) 2023-2027.
- Actively participated in fundraising endeavors by assisting in the preparation of grant proposals and concept
notes.

**Research Associate(Wissenschaftlicher mitarbeiter)  @ Center for Remote Sensing of Land Surfaces, University of Bonn (_March 2022 - July 2023_)**
- Conducted comprehensive research to gather and organize information, summaries, and materials pertaining to
Copernicus and its diverse components, including datasets and services.
- Established and expanded a network of contacts, encompassing potential Copernicus users across various user
groups in multiple African nations.
- Evaluated user needs and requirements concerning Copernicus through methods such as interviews, surveys, and
engagement at events like UN-Spider expert meetings, fostering dialogue with aforementioned contacts and user
groups.
- Produced training resources, including online brochures, tutorials and video guides, covering various aspects
of Copernicus applications. These products were made publicly available through: https://www.zfl.uni-
